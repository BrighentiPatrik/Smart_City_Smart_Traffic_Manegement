# Smart_City_Smart_Traffic_Manegement
The goal of the project is to create an iot architecture that have to orchestrate the traffic in a one or more city's zones.

## History
This is a project exposed for the exam of the course Intelligent Internet of Thing that i've took during my bachelor's degree at the [Universit√† degli studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia](https://www.unimore.it/)

## Architecture
The project emulate three different smart objects, that are:
1. Data Collector:&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A central object that acts as a manager that is used to execute application logic.
2. Smart Camera:&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It takes care of capturing and sending information useful for traffic orchestration.         
3. Smart Traffic Light:&emsp; Its operating policies are set by the central controller to favor city traffic.

## Interaction Flow
Each smart object is associated with an executing thread, video cameras implement the Sensor interface, while semaphores implement the actuators interface. The cameras periodically publish the number of bikes, vehicles and pedestrians in their field of view. The datacollector is subscribed to the topics of the video cameras and based on the data it receives, it can set different operating policies by publishing on its topics to which the semaphores are subscribed.
The semaphores subscribed to certain topics update their operating policy as indicated by the data collector.
